      <p>Google Classroom is a free blended learning platform developed by
         Google for educational institutions that aims to simplify creating,
          distributing, and grading assignments. The primary purpose of Google Classroom is 
          to streamline the process of sharing files between teachers and students.As of 2021, 
          approximately 150 million users use Google Classroom.

        Google Classroom uses a variety of proprietary user applications (Google Applications for Education)
         with the goal of managing student and teacher communication. Students can be invited to join a class through
          a private code or be imported automatically from a school domain. Each class creates a separate folder in the
           respective user's Google Drive, where the student can submit work to be graded by a teacher. Teachers can monitor
            each student's progress by reviewing the revision history of a document, and, after being graded, teachers can 
            return work along with comments and grades     </p>
